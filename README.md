Calendar
============================

For best results, import into an instance of Cascade running version 7.2 or greater. Results may vary importing into 7.0.x because of potential database structure changes and updates to how Dynamic Metadata are created/stored.

Features include:

* Main calendar with month, week, and day views.
* List and term views.
* Landing pages for each event.
* Multi-channel output for a variety of pages (XHTML, PDF, RSS, iCal, XML).
* Repeatable events.
